#### Lore:
[[Heartseeker]]'s true origins are shrouded in mystery, but legends suggest it was forged for an elven assassin who sought to end conflicts with minimal bloodshed by targeting critical points. It demands a wielder of both strength and cunning, someone who values precision over brute force. [[Elara 'Ironheart' Vancroft]] is believed to be the latest in a long line of guardians, entrusted not only with the blade's power but also with its secrets. It is said the sword subtly guides its wielder's hand towards the "heart" of any problem, be it a physical foe or a strategic dilemma.
