**Name:** Kaelen "Ironhand" Stonefist

**Description:** Kaelen is a gruff, broad-shouldered barkeep with grey-streaked red hair and a face etched with old scars. He runs [[The Cloud's Edge]] with a watchful eye, quick to quell trouble but a fount of hard-earned wisdom for earnest adventurers. He's a quiet observer, capable of offering cryptic advice or crucial information for those who earn his respect.

**Background & History:**  
Kaelen's moniker, "Ironhand," isn't just for show; it's a testament to his past as a formidable adventurer, a veteran warrior whose exploits are whispered in hushed tones among the older patrons of Outer Heaven. His scars tell tales of battles against monstrous beasts, daring dungeon delves, and skirmishes with ruthless bandits. While he rarely speaks of his adventuring days, the way he carries himself, the keen glint in his eyes, and his uncanny ability to anticipate trouble all betray a lifetime spent on the edge of danger. He retired from active adventuring years ago, seeking a quieter life, but found that the bustle of a tavern, especially one frequented by adventurers, kept him connected to the world he once dominated.

**Personality & Demeanor:**  
Beneath his gruff exterior lies a deep well of experience and a surprising sense of loyalty. Kaelen is a man of few words, preferring to listen and observe. He has a dry wit that surfaces occasionally, often delivered with a knowing smirk. He has little patience for arrogance or foolishness but a soft spot for genuine courage and those who show potential. He's fiercely protective of his regulars and the integrity of his establishment.

**Role in Outer Heaven:**  
Beyond his duties as barkeep, Kaelen serves as a vital anchor in the adventuring community. He's a living legend, a source of both practical advice and cautionary tales. His tavern, [[The Cloud's Edge]], acts as an unofficial hub for information exchange, and Kaelen himself is often the first to hear about new threats, emerging opportunities, or the comings and goings of important figures.
