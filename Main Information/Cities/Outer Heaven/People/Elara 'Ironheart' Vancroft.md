#### Appearance & Demeanor:
*   **Key physical features:** Medium height with a lean, athletic build. Her dark, practical braid often falls over one shoulder, revealing a sharp, intelligent gaze from her steel-grey eyes. A faint, jagged scar runs along her jawline, a testament to past battles.
*   **Overall impression:** Resolute and pragmatic, she carries herself with an air of quiet authority. She rarely smiles broadly, but her expressions are always genuine and direct.
*   **Voice and common mannerisms:** Her voice is low and steady, carrying a hint of gravel from years of shouting commands over battle or wind. She often crosses her arms, observing situations with a critical, experienced eye.

#### Personality & Quirks:
*   **Personality traits:** Resilient, fiercely loyal, pragmatic, and a natural leader. She values honesty and courage above all else.
*   **Likes, dislikes, and a memorable habit or quirk:** 
	* Likes strong coffee, well-maintained gear, and adventurers who know when to listen. 
	* Dislikes arrogance, unnecessary risks, and those who exploit the weak. 
	* She has a habit of tapping her fingers rhythmically when deep in thought, a subtle sign of her restless mind.
*   **Core fear or weakness:** Failing to protect those under her charge, or seeing good people fall due to her misjudgment.

#### Background & Reputation:
*   **Brief origin story or significant past event:** Elara earned her "Ironheart" moniker during a legendary defense of a besieged outpost, where her unwavering resolve inspired a ragtag group to hold the line against impossible odds. She and [[Kaelen 'Ironhand' Stonefist]] were once formidable adventuring partners, their names often spoken in the same breath across the taverns of Outer Heaven. While Kaelen retired to run [[The Cloud's Edge]], Elara chose to continue serving the adventuring community in a more administrative, yet still active, capacity.
*   **How others generally perceive them:** A respected veteran, a fair but firm hand within the Adventurer's Guild, and a reliable source of information and guidance. Many younger adventurers look up to her, while older ones remember her legendary exploits.

#### Goals & Motivations:
*   **What they want most:** To ensure the safety and prosperity of Outer Heaven's adventuring community, and to maintain the delicate balance of power within the city.
*   **What drives them:** A deep-seated sense of duty, a desire to prevent the mistakes of the past, and a quiet hope that the next generation of heroes will be even greater.

#### Connections & Resources:
*   **Key allies or rivals:** Her closest confidant and old friend is [[Kaelen 'Ironhand' Stonefist]], with whom she often shares a quiet drink at [[The Cloud's Edge]]. She has extensive contacts within [[The Adventurer's Guild Hall - Outer Heaven]] and a network of informants among the various airship crews and planar travelers.
*   **Notable possessions or skills:** Wields a masterwork longsword, [[Heartseeker]] which she rarely draws but keeps meticulously maintained. Possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of planar lore and monster weaknesses, and an uncanny ability to assess an adventurer's true capabilities.

#### Current Situation & Hooks:
*   **What they are currently doing or struggling with:** Elara is currently overseeing the Guild's efforts to stabilize several newly discovered planar rifts, a task made more complex by the recent disappearance of a key expedition to Xylos (as per '[[Crystalline Lament]]' quest). She's struggling to find reliable teams willing to undertake such dangerous, dimension-hopping missions.
*   **A secret they keep or a potential way for players to get involved:** Elara carries the burden of a past decision that led to the loss of a close friend during a planar expedition years ago, a secret she shares only with Kaelen. She might approach the players directly, impressed by their reputation, to undertake a critical mission related to the planar rifts, or to investigate a suspicious activity that threatens the Guild's operations.
