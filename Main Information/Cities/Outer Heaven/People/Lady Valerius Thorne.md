#### Appearance & Demeanor:
*   **Key physical features:** Impeccably dressed in tailored, dark suits. Sharp, aristocratic features, always perfectly groomed with slicked-back dark hair. Piercing, calculating blue eyes.
*   **Overall impression:** Posh, condescending, exuding an air of effortless superiority and control. She never seems ruffled.
*   **Voice and common mannerisms:** A smooth, modulated, deep resonant voice that rarely raises above a polite conversational level. Her gestures are precise and minimal. A subtle, almost imperceptible smirk often plays on her lips.

#### Personality & Quirks:
*   **Personality traits:** Shrewd, arrogant, discerning, elitist, and obsessively private.
*   **Likes, dislikes, and a memorable habit or quirk:**
	* Likes rare vintage spirits, high-stakes negotiations, intelligent conversation, and absolute discretion.
	* Dislikes vulgarity, incompetence, open displays of emotion, and being underestimated. 
	* She has a habit of subtly polishing a golden signet ring when deep in thought or mildly annoyed.
*   **Core fear or weakness:** Loss of control, public scandal, or anything that might tarnish the legendary discretion and exclusivity of his establishment or his own reputation.
#### Background & Reputation:
*   **Brief origin story or significant past event:** Hailing from an old, minor noble house fallen on hard times, Valerius meticulously rebuilt his family's fortune not through traditional means, but through the currency of information and discretion, culminating in his shrewd acquisition and elevation of The Wyvern's Roost into a premier establishment.
*   **How others generally perceive them:** A master of subtle manipulation, utterly professional, and cold but fair in business dealings. Respected and feared for his connections and the countless secrets he undoubtedly holds. Many see him as an unapproachable gatekeeper to Outer Heaven's elite.

#### Goals & Motivations:
*   **What they want most:** To solidify The Wyvern's Roost as *the* undisputed nexus for high-stakes dealings and information in Outer Heaven, ensuring its unparalleled reputation for security and discretion remains absolute.
*   **What drives them:** The pursuit of ultimate influence, subtle control, and the inherent power that comes from knowing things others don't. He values prestige and exclusivity above all.

#### Connections & Resources:
*   **Key allies or rivals:** Has a discreet network of high-profile clients and informants spanning across various factions, including guild leaders, merchant princes, and even government officials. Rivals are anyone who directly threatens the Wyvern's Roost's exclusivity or attempts to undermine his authority.
*   **Notable possessions or skills:** Commands the absolute loyalty of his highly trained and discreet staff. Possesses an extensive personal network of contacts. Master of observation, deduction, and reading people.

#### Current Situation & Hooks:
*   **What they are currently doing or struggling with:** Managing the complex and delicate web of interactions within The Wyvern's Roost, ensuring its reputation remains untarnished amidst increasing demands for its private services. She might be subtly orchestrating a clandestine meeting between two major rival powers.
*   **A secret they keep or a potential way for players to get involved:** The true extent of her information network is far wider than anyone suspects, including seemingly untouchable individuals. She often requires "untraceable" agents for delicate tasks outside the inn that require finesse and discretion over brute force, offering high rewards for success and utter silence.
