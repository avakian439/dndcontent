[[The Sky-Gardens]] are a breathtaking testament to [[Outer Heaven]]'s blend of ancient magic and modern ingenuity. These aren't mere patches of green; they are sprawling, multi-tiered botanical wonders, magically sustained and meticulously cultivated. Lush, vibrant flora, some native to the highest mountain peaks and others conjured from distant planes, thrives under the open sky, their roots drawing sustenance from the Mythallar's ambient magic.

Cascading waterfalls tumble into crystal-clear ponds, reflecting the endless expanse of clouds above. Pathways wind through groves of shimmering trees and beds of bioluminescent flowers, leading to secluded gazebos and open vistas that offer unparalleled views of the world far below. The air here is always fresh, carrying the scent of exotic blossoms and damp earth, a stark contrast to the bustling, often metallic scent of the city's lower districts.

While a popular spot for quiet contemplation and romantic strolls, the Sky-Gardens also serve a more discreet purpose in [[Outer Heaven]]'s anarcho-capitalist landscape. Their many secluded nooks and hidden alcoves make them ideal locations for clandestine meetings, hushed negotiations between rival factions, or discreet exchanges of information and goods away from prying eyes. For the weary adventurer, it's a sanctuary – a place to find a moment of peace, reflect on past deeds, or simply marvel at the beauty of a world suspended between the heavens and the earth.
