The Grand Bazaar is the commercial heart of [[Outer Heaven]], a sprawling, chaotic, and vibrant district where anything and everything can be bought or sold for the right price. Its winding streets are a kaleidoscope of color, sound, and scent, from the aroma of exotic spices and arcane reagents to the cacophony of haggling merchants and the shimmering glow of enchanted goods.

### Atmosphere
The air hums with a palpable energy. Banners and brightly-colored awnings hang between intricately carved buildings, creating a permanent canopy over the crowded streets. The Bazaar is a melting pot of cultures from across [[Orizia]], and the languages spoken here are as varied as the goods on display. By day, it is a bustling hub of commerce; by night, the glow of magic lanterns illuminates a shadow economy of information brokers, smugglers, and clandestine meetings.

### Key Locations
*	**[[The Gilded Crucible]]**: An alchemist's paradise run by the meticulous [[Elara Vane]]. It's known for its stock of rare spell components and potent potions, though the prices are as steep as the nearby mountains.
*	**[[Celestial Forgeworks]]**: A renowned smithy operated by the dwarf [[Borgoth Stonehand]]. He specializes in incorporating celestial metals and enchantments into his weapons and armor, creating pieces of legendary quality.
*	**[[The Wanderer's Chart]]**: A cluttered shop filled with maps, scrolls, and books of lore. Its owner, a quiet elf named [[Lianor]], is a master cartographer who also trades in secrets and rumors for the right price.
*	**[[The Menagerie of Whispers]]**: An establishment that deals in exotic and magical beasts. Run by the flamboyant [[Captain Valerius]], it's the place to acquire a unique familiar or a monstrous guard animal.

### Notable NPCs
*	**[[Master Zafira]]**: The unofficial guild master of the Bazaar. A sharp-witted and influential human merchant who oversees trade disputes and maintains a semblance of order. She can be a powerful ally or a formidable obstacle.
*	**[[Silas the Appraiser]]**: A mysterious, half-blind tiefling who operates from a small, dusty stall. He has an uncanny ability to identify the history and properties of any magic item brought to him, often revealing forgotten or cursed legacies.

#### Current Situation & Hooks
*	**The Missing Ingredient**: [[Elara Vane]] of [[The Gilded Crucible]] is desperately seeking a live Phoenix feather for a wealthy client. She's offering a substantial reward, but warns that the last person who tried to acquire one was found turned to ash.
*	**A Map to Nowhere**: A frantic noble claims that [[Lianor]] from [[The Wanderer's Chart]] sold him a fraudulent map to a lost family treasure. He wants to hire the party to retrieve his gold and "teach the elf a lesson," but Lianor insists the map is genuine and the noble simply lacks the wits to decipher it.
*	**An Escaped Creature**: One of [[Captain Valerius]]'s prized creatures—a displacer beast kitten—has escaped from [[The Menagerie of Whispers]]. He needs it found before it grows larger and the City Guard gets involved. He's offering a generous reward and one of his "less dangerous" beasts in trade.
