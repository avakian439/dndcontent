The Old Ballista Ramparts are the weathered, decommissioned outer defenses of [[Outer Heaven]]. This windswept ring of crumbling stone and silent siege weaponry offers the most breathtaking, and unprotected, views of the endless sky below. It is a place of solitude, secrets, and forgotten history.

#### District Summary:
*	**Premise:** The ancient, crumbling defensive ring of the city, now serving as a quiet overlook, a place for clandestine meetings, and a home to forgotten mechanisms and memories.
*	**Reputation:** Known as a lonely, melancholic place to escape the city's chaos. Adventurers and spies value its seclusion for secret dealings, while scavengers whisper of finding rare components from the old war machines. It's said the ghosts of the city's first defenders still keep watch here.

#### Atmosphere & Ambiance:
*	**Visuals:** Massive, dormant ballistae sit aimed at the horizon, their metal frames pitted with age and rust. Crumbling stone parapets are overgrown with resilient sky-moss and hardy, wind-strafed flora. The view is a panoramic, dizzying vista of the clouds and distant lands.
*	**Sounds:** The dominant sound is the constant, whistling moan of the wind as it whips around the fortress. This is punctuated by the distant hum of the city, the groan of stressed metal, and the scuttling of unseen creatures in the stonework's crevices.
*	**Scents:** A sharp scent of ozone from the high altitude, mixed with the smell of damp stone, wild flora, and the faint, metallic tang of rust and old, solidified lubricating oil.
*	**General Feel:** The district evokes a profound sense of history and solitude. It is peaceful yet tinged with the melancholy of forgotten glory. Standing on the edge, one feels exposed to the vastness of the world, a stark contrast to the dense confines of districts like [[The Iron Slums]].

#### Key Features & Landmarks:
*	**The Silent Cannons:** A dozen colossal, arcane-powered ballistae line the Ramparts. Long thought inert, their targeting crystals still faintly glow under specific celestial alignments. Scavenging parts from them is dangerous but potentially lucrative.
*	**The Watcher's Peak:** The highest point of the Ramparts, marked by a lone, twisted metal flagpole. It's a favored spot for quiet reflection, romantic liaisons, and clandestine observation of arrivals at [[The Astral Anchorage]].
*	**The Smuggler's Drop:** A cleverly hidden section of collapsed wall conceals a robust, if rickety, winch system. It's a primary, unsanctioned route for getting goods and people on or off [[Outer Heaven]] without official notice.
*	**Sir Kaelan's Rest:** A single, unmarked stone cairn serves as a memorial to a legendary knight who fell during a siege ages ago. Locals claim his spirit still walks the Ramparts, pointing out towards the sky when danger approaches the city.

#### Factions & NPCs:
*	**The Wind-Gryphons:** A territorial gang of Aarakocra scavengers who claim the Ramparts as their domain. They are hostile to outsiders but may be willing to trade rare parts or information for the right price. Their leader is a grizzled warrior named **Kee-lar**.
*	**Elara Vance:** A quiet, observant historian and descendant of an ancient city guard. She spends her days sketching the ancient mechanisms and documenting the erosion. She knows more about the Ramparts' hidden passages and secrets than anyone, but trusts few.

#### Current Situation & Hooks:
*	**A Lingering Echo:** A wealthy collector from [[The Grand Bazaar]] believes a focusing crystal from one of the Silent Cannons is the key to a powerful magical device. He hires the party to retrieve it, but the Wind-Gryphons believe the crystals are sacred relics and will protect them fiercely.
*	**The Ghostly Warning:** The spirit of **Sir Kaelan** has become increasingly active, its spectral form seen nightly, pointing frantically towards a specific point in the sky. The [[Adventurer's Guild Hall - Outer Heaven]] has issued a contract to investigate the nature of this warning before it's too late.
*	**Emergency Evacuation:** A frantic informant needs to use the Smuggler's Drop to escape [[Outer Heaven]]. They have stolen critical information from a powerful faction and are being hunted. They offer their last pouch of coin and the data slate for an armed escort to and down the winch.
