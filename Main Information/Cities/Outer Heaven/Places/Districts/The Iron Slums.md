### District Summary:
*	**Premise:** A gritty, lower-deck district bolted to the city's superstructure, serving as the home for [[Outer Heaven]]'s working class and a hub for off-the-books services and minor illicit dealings.
*	**Reputation:** Known as a place where the law is thin and survival depends on your connections and wits. It's the best place to get something fixed quietly or to find muscle for hire, but a terrible place to get lost.

#### Atmosphere & Ambiance:
*	**Visuals:** A maze of riveted iron walkways, cramped hab-units, and makeshift repair shops. Steam vents hiss from rusted pipes overhead, casting the area in a perpetual, damp haze. Exposed wiring sparks intermittently, casting fleeting shadows.
*	**Sounds:** The constant percussive clang of hammers on steel, the hiss of pneumatics, the low hum of overworked generators, and the distant shouts from taverns like [[The Greasy Cog Tavern]].
*	**Scents:** The air is thick with the smell of ozone, hot metal, burning ship fuel, and cheap synth-ale.
*	**General Feel:** Evokes a sense of constant struggle and gritty resilience. It feels cramped, dangerous, and alive with a restless, chaotic energy.

#### Key Features & Landmarks:
*	**The Great Vent:** A massive, central exhaust port for the city's lower engines. It periodically releases huge plumes of hot steam, serving as an unofficial district clock.
*	**Rivet Walkways:** The primary "streets" of the Slums, a precarious network of suspended metal catwalks connecting different sections.
*	**Scrap Heap Point:** A vast pile of discarded metal and broken machinery that teeters over the edge of the district. It's a dangerous but valuable source of parts for scavengers.

#### Economy & Trade:
*	**Main Industries:** Unofficial airship repair and maintenance, scrap metal salvaging, black market trade, and manual labor for [[The Astral Anchorage|The Anchorage]].
*	**Key Exports/Imports:** Exports: repaired components, "creatively sourced" parts, hired muscle. Imports: smuggled goods, raw materials, food rations.
*	**Trade Routes:** Unofficial trade flows between [[The Astral Anchorage]] and [[The Grand Bazaar]], bypassing the hefty tolls and private security checkpoints of the major corporate-controlled sky-lanes. The Whisper Market network connects it to the city's wider criminal underworld.

#### Government & Control:
*	**Governing Body:** The Slums are considered 'unregulated territory' by the major corporate and guild powers of [[Outer Heaven]]. There is no formal governing body; control is asserted through force and influence by local gangs.
*	**Laws & Enforcement:** The only "law" is enforced by gangs like [[The Gilded Crows]] through protection rackets and intimidation. Disputes are settled directly and violently.
*	**Major Factions:** [[The Gilded Crows]] (emerging crime syndicate), The Mechanics' Guild (a loose, unofficial collective of workers), and the network of brokers run by [[Corvus the Cipher]].

#### Demographics:
*	**Population Demographics:** Primarily working-class humans, orcs, and goblins. A significant population of mechanics, ship hands, smugglers, and disenfranchised laborers. Few live here by choice.

#### Notable Locations:
*	**[[The Greasy Cog Tavern]]**: A notorious dive bar and hiring hall run by the imposing [[Borka Sledgefist]].
*	**[[Ratchet's Repairs]]**: The workshop of [[Petra "Ratchet" Vance]], a brilliant but indebted ship mechanic.
*	**The Whisper Market:** Not a single building, but a network of alleyway dealers and information brokers coordinated by [[Corvus the Cipher]].

#### Key Figures (NPCs):
*	**[[Borka Sledgefist]]**: (Male Orc) Proprietor of The Greasy Cog, a retired enforcer who maintains a fragile peace in his tavern.
*	**[[Petra "Ratchet" Vance]]**: (Female Human) A genius mechanic trying to work her way out of debt to [[The Gilded Crows]].
*	**[[Corvus the Cipher]]**: (Unknown) The unseen spymaster who controls the district's flow of information and smuggled goods.

#### Current Events & Hooks:
*	**Ongoing Issues:** [[The Gilded Crows]] are aggressively expanding their territory, putting pressure on independent operators. Occasional, brutal raids by corporate enforcers from [[The Astral Anchorage|The Anchorage]]—searching for stolen goods or fugitives—make life even more precarious.
*	**Potential Hooks:**
	*	An airship captain needs the party to find their missing engineer, last seen losing a card game to a member of [[The Gilded Crows]] at The Greasy Cog.
	*	[[Petra "Ratchet" Vance]] needs a rare, stolen part to complete a job for the party, requiring them to raid a rival scrap gang's stash.
	*	To get critical information, the party must contact [[Corvus the Cipher]] by completing a dead-drop delivery deep within the Slums' most dangerous territory.

#### Challenges & Threats:
*	**Internal:** Turf wars between [[The Gilded Crows]] and smaller crews. The structural instability of the older walkways. The constant threat of robbery and violence.
*	**External:** Brutal incursions by corporate enforcers from wealthier districts. Exploitation by powerful merchants from [[The Grand Bazaar]] and ship owners from [[The Astral Anchorage|The Anchorage]] who view the Slums as a lawless recruiting pool and dumping ground.
