### The Adventurer's Guild Hall - Outer Heaven

#### Overview:
The Adventurer's Guild Hall in [[Outer Heaven]] is the bustling heart of the city's mercenary and exploration scene. It serves as the primary hub for adventurers seeking work, registering their deeds, and finding camaraderie (or rivalry) among their peers.

Atmosphere & Reputation:
The Hall is a cacophony of clanking armor, boisterous laughter, hushed negotiations, and the scratching of quills. It's a place where fresh-faced novices nervously eye the quest board alongside grizzled veterans swapping tales of daring feats. Its reputation is generally solid; the Guild pays reliably, offers a wide range of contracts, and provides a measure of protection for its members. However, some view it as a bureaucratic necessity, while others whisper of its hidden agendas or the occasional "disappearance" of adventurers on particularly dangerous contracts.

#### Key Services & Facilities:

*   **The Grand Quest Board:** A massive oak board dominating the common room, constantly updated with contracts ranging from simple monster hunts and escort missions to complex investigations and dungeon delves. Quests are color-coded by difficulty and reward.
*   **The Ironclad Armory:** A well-stocked shop run by **Grizelda 'Forgeheart' Stonebrow**, offering standard adventuring gear, weapons, armor, and repair services. She also deals in rare components for custom work.
*   **The Scribe's Nook:** Barnaby Grumbles' cramped office, where adventurers register, collect payments, and negotiate contract specifics. It's also where official Guild records are kept.
*   **The Common Room & Tavern:** "The Weary Wanderer" is the Guild's tavern, serving hearty food and strong drink. It's a prime spot for gathering rumors, finding party members, or just unwinding after a perilous journey.
*   **Training Grounds:** Located in the basement, these facilities include sparring rings, target ranges, and even a small magical practice chamber for members to hone their skills.
*   **The Archives:** A small, dusty library containing maps, monster lore, historical records, and reports from past expeditions. Access is usually restricted to higher-ranking members or those with special permission, often managed by Barnaby or a dedicated archivist.
