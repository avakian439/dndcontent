### Quest Summary
A brief overview of the quest's premise and the initial hook.
*   **Premise:** A previous expedition to the unstable, crystalline dimension of Xylos has vanished. The dimension itself is a beautiful but deadly landscape of living crystals and planar instability.
*   **Hook:** The party is approached by a frantic, slightly unhinged recruiter named [[Joric "The Shard-Seeker" Thorne]] at [[The Astral Anchorage]]. He's loudly proclaiming the urgent need for brave (or foolhardy) adventurers to join his crew for a high-risk, high-reward journey to Xylos. He offers a substantial upfront payment and a share of any recovered "Shard of Aethel" – a rare crystal said to hum with raw planar energy, vital for stabilizing dimensional rifts.

### Objectives
What the players need to accomplish.
*   Travel to the dimension of Xylos via [[Joric's]] specialized planar vessel.
*   Locate the missing expedition and determine their fate.
*   Retrieve a Shard of Aethel, a crystal crucial for planar stability.
*   Return to [[Outer Heaven]] with the crystal and any survivors.

### Key Players
Important NPCs and antagonists.
*   **Quest Giver:** **Joric "The Shard-Seeker" Thorne**. A grizzled, slightly paranoid planar explorer, haunted by past failures but driven by the promise of the Shard of Aethel. He's loud, theatrical, and desperate in his recruitment, often seen shouting his needs near the Portal Arches.
*   **Antagonist:** **The Shard-Weavers**. Indigenous, elemental creatures of Xylos, perhaps crystalline golems or shard-beasts, that are drawn to and empowered by the Shards of Aethel. They aggressively defend their territory and the crystals, seeing them as part of their very being. The dimension itself, with its unpredictable planar rifts and sharp, living crystals, also acts as a formidable antagonist.

### Challenges
Main obstacles and encounters.
*   **Planar Navigation:** Piloting or navigating through unstable planar rifts and the treacherous, ever-shifting crystalline terrain of Xylos.
*   **Environmental Hazards:** Dealing with the razor-sharp flora, disorienting echoes, blinding light refractions, and unpredictable magical surges inherent to Xylos.
*   **Shard-Weavers:** Combat encounters with the crystalline creatures, which might possess abilities like regeneration, crystal manipulation, or energy absorption.
*   **Psychological Strain:** The alien environment and isolation can take a toll on the party's mental fortitude.
*   **Lost Expedition Clues:** Piecing together the fate of the previous expedition from scattered logs, damaged equipment, or spectral echoes.
*   **Crew Dynamics:** Potential for conflict or betrayal among Joric's hastily assembled crew, or even Joric's own paranoia leading to difficult decisions.

### Outcome
Rewards and consequences of success or failure.
*   **Success:**
    *   **Rewards:** Joric pays handsomely (e.g., 5,000-10,000 gold pieces, plus a share of the Shard of Aethel's value). The party gains significant reputation as planar explorers and heroes.
    *   **Impact:** The Shard of Aethel can be used to stabilize Outer Heaven's own Mythallar, or perhaps crafted into powerful magic items, preventing further planar instability.
*   **Failure:**
    *   **Consequences:** The party is lost in Xylos, or barely escapes with their lives, gaining a negative reputation. Joric's expedition fails, and the Shard of Aethel remains unrecovered, potentially leading to worsening planar instability or new threats emerging from uncontrolled rifts near Outer Heaven.
