### Quest Summary:
A brief overview of the quest's premise and the initial hook.
*   **Premise:** The colossal [[Outer Heaven#^e2bee3|Mythallar]], the magical heart sustaining [[Outer Heaven]], is showing signs of instability. Energy fluctuations are causing minor tremors, flickering lights, and a growing unease among the populace. If not addressed, the city could lose altitude or even fall.
*   **Hook:** A frantic message is posted at [[The Adventurer's Guild Hall - Outer Heaven]], or a concerned Arch-Mage from [[The Spire of Whispers]] seeks skilled individuals to investigate the Mythallar's core within [[The Under-City Conduits]] and stabilize it. Rumors of sabotage or a magical blight are circulating.

### Objectives:
What the players need to accomplish.
*   Investigate the source of the Mythallar's instability within [[The Under-City Conduits]].
*   Identify the cause (sabotage, magical blight, structural decay, creature infestation).
*   Neutralize the threat or repair the damage to stabilize the Mythallar.
*   Report findings and resolution to the quest giver.

### Key Players:
Important NPCs and antagonists.
*   **Quest Giver:** [[Arch-Mage Seraphina]] (from [[The Spire of Whispers]], concerned about the Mythallar's arcane integrity) or [[Guild Master Borin Stonebeard]] (from [[The Adventurer's Guild Hall - Outer Heaven]], focused on city security).
*   **Antagonist:**
    *   **Option 1 (Sabotage):** A shadowy organization seeking to destabilize [[Outer Heaven]] for political or economic gain, operating from within [[The Under-City Conduits]].
    *   **Option 2 (Magical Blight/Creature):** An ancient, energy-draining entity or a parasitic magical growth that has latched onto the Mythallar's conduits, slowly siphoning its power.

### Challenges:
Main obstacles and encounters.
*   **Environmental Hazards:** Unstable magical energy surges, collapsing sections of [[The Under-City Conduits]], arcane traps, areas of anti-magic or wild magic.
*   **Creature Encounters:** Energy elementals, constructs corrupted by the instability, shadowy creatures drawn to the weakening magic, or guardians placed by saboteurs.
*   **Puzzles/Skill Challenges:** Deciphering ancient schematics, rerouting energy flows, disarming magical wards, navigating complex magical machinery.
*   **Social Challenges:** Dealing with panicked citizens, rival adventuring parties also seeking to "fix" the problem (perhaps with less noble intentions), or uncovering the saboteur's network.

### Outcome:
Rewards and consequences of success or failure.
*   **Success:**
    *   **Rewards:** Significant monetary reward, rare magical items (perhaps related to the Mythallar's energy), reputation boost with [[Outer Heaven]]'s factions (Guild, Mages), potential access to restricted areas or knowledge.
    *   **Consequences:** [[Outer Heaven]] is saved, its stability restored, and the party is hailed as heroes. The cause of the instability is dealt with, preventing future occurrences.
*   **Failure:**
    *   **Consequences:** The Mythallar's instability worsens, leading to partial power outages, sections of the city losing altitude, or even a catastrophic failure causing [[Outer Heaven]] to plummet. Widespread panic, loss of life, and a severe blow to the party's reputation. The antagonist (if any) achieves their goal.
