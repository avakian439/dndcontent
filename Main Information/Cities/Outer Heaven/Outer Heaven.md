[^1]: A _Mythallar_ is a magical device, typically represented similarly to a crystal ball, that converted raw magical power into energies that could be used by "quasimagical items" (meaning magical items that only functioned within the area-of-effect of a _Mythallar_) to manifest several magical effects at once.
