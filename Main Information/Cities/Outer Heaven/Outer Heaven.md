[[Outer Heaven]] is a magnificent **flying-fortress city**, a hub for adventurers everywhere to gather and share stories and forge new legends. It soars high above the clouds, a colossal marvel of ancient engineering and powerful magic.
# Overview
- - -
This sprawling metropolis, sustained by a colossal **Mythallar**[^1], operates without a central authority. Its defense is entirely privatized, relying on the formidable adventurers who freely choose to protect their interests and investments within its bounds. While its structure hints at a past era of state-like defense, [[Outer Heaven]]'s true strength is its vibrant, self-governing populace. Ancient defenses are historical relics; security is maintained by independent patrols and contracted airship fleets, ensuring reconnaissance and rapid response, all funded through voluntary contributions and service agreements. 

As a beacon of free enterprise, [[Outer Heaven]] thrives. [[The Adventurer's Guild Hall |Guild Halls]] function as independent contracting agencies, while taverns like "[[The Cloud's Edge]]" and "[[The Wyvern's Roost]]" facilitate private deals and information exchange. Its vibrant bazaars offer goods and services. This safe haven is not governed, but *secured* by the voluntary actions and self-interest of the heroes it attracts, whose presence is its ultimate deterrent and guarantee of liberty.

[^1]: A _Mythallar_ is a magical device, typically represented similarly to a crystal ball, that converted raw magical power into energies that could be used by "quasimagical items" (meaning magical items that only functioned within the area-of-effect of a _Mythallar_) to manifest several magical effects at once.
