## **1) Worker Drones on Autopilot**

**Type:** Environmental / Combat Optional

**Setup:**  
Near the Intake Gantry, a half-dozen **biological transport drones** march in perfect rhythm, each carrying empty containment pods. Their metallic exteriors are scuffed, their optics dim. Occasionally one stops, scans the ground, and resumes its patrol.

**Mechanics:**

- If a character emits a biological signature (i.e. anything living), the drones attempt to “retrieve” them.
    
- Grapple checks or Strength saves (DC 14–15) to resist collection.
    
- They do not attack unless damaged; they use non-lethal restraints.
    

**Logic:**  
Their command subroutines have not received updates in centuries. To them, _any_ living organic is “material awaiting processing.”

**Outcomes / Escalations:**

- PCs may disable, repair, or hack them (Int/Tech checks).
    
- Destroying them triggers local alerts.
    
- Reprogramming grants a **temporary escort** that can open doors and carry heavy items.
    

**Reward / Information:**  
Recovered drone cores contain logs of constant operation for 900+ years, confirming the plant never truly stopped.

## **2) Enzyme Bath Leak**

**Type:** Environmental Hazard

**Setup:**  
A hallway floor slopes into a pool of pale yellow fluid emitting faint vapor. Organic matter within (leaves, cloth, a skeleton) is dissolving into sludge. Pipes overhead leak intermittently.

**Mechanics:**

- Contact deals 2d6 acid damage per round (or Constitution save DC 15 to resist).
    
- Metal equipment unaffected.
    
- Stepping stones, metal scaffolds, or improvised bridges can bypass.
    

**Logic:**  
A ruptured pipe from an enzyme tank is dripping catalytic acid used in biomass reduction. It’s supposed to circulate within a closed loop.

**Outcomes / Escalations:**

- Shut down leak from nearby valve panel (Investigation/Engineering DC 14).
    
- Spill spreads slowly; staying too long causes corridor blockage.
    
- Cutting the flow too quickly bursts another pipe.
    

**Reward / Information:**  
Collecting samples yields a **universal organic solvent** usable for later puzzles or scientific study.

##  **3) Jammed Conversion Stage**

**Type:** Puzzle / Hazard

**Setup:**  
Deep in the main conveyor line, a massive auger pump grinds, squealing and halting. Red hazard lights flash “PROCESSING ERROR.” The line keeps trying to restart every few minutes.

**Mechanics:**

- A Strength (Athletics) or Engineering check (DC 16) clears the blockage.
    
- Failing a clearing attempt risks rupture (Dex save DC 14 to avoid spray of hot slurry).
    
- Observant PCs can find a manual stop lever behind panels (Investigation DC 13).
    

**Logic:**  
A jammed organic mass hardened mid-cycle due to enzyme imbalance, forming an obstruction.

**Outcomes / Escalations:**

- Clearing it safely restores power and movement (granting access to another area).
    
- Forcing it causes a **minor explosion** and bio-slurry flood, damaging the area but revealing maintenance shafts below.
    

**Reward / Information:**  
Inside the blockage are half-dissolved tags referencing _specimen transport from Genetics Division_, showing the plant was once supplied with fauna directly from Nemamiah’s lab.

##  **4) Biocore Reactor Instability**

**Type:** Crisis Encounter

**Setup:**  
A spherical reactor chamber throbs with pulsing red light. Its internal turbines are cycling unevenly, producing bursts of light and noise. Sensors report “Thermal Regulation Failure.”

**Mechanics:**

- Tech/Arcana checks (DC 15–17) can stabilize via control panels.
    
- Strength (DC 14) can manually vent heat valves.
    
- Failing to act within 3 rounds causes an energy pulse (4d6 radiant/fire damage to all in room).
    

**Logic:**  
A control enzyme regulating biomass-to-energy conversion degraded. The core can no longer maintain temperature equilibrium.

**Outcomes / Escalations:**

- Stabilizing restores partial lighting to the whole floor (new access).
    
- Venting steam burns organic matter nearby, potentially destroying stored samples.
    
- Doing nothing results in a **contained meltdown**, sealing this section.
    

**Reward / Information:**  
Recovered **Biocore Shard** (stable portable energy cell) — valuable for research or barter.

##  **5) Blind Foraging Creature**

**Type:** Exploration / Low-Threat Creature

**Setup:**  
In dark maintenance corridors, the group hears wet scraping. A small pale quadruped (think mole-rat with armor plates) sniffs the air. It’s eyeless but reacts to heat and vibration.

**Mechanics:**

- Passive Perception check (DC 12) notices it before it notices them.
    
- Can be calmed with food or low heat source.
    
- Sudden light/noise startles it → it flees.
    

**Logic:**  
Descendant of fauna drawn into the plant centuries ago. It adapted to live on enzyme runoff and waste heat.

**Outcomes / Escalations:**

- Harmless if left alone.
    
- Killing it yields tissue rich in heat-resistant enzymes (valuable sample).
    
- If chased or injured, emits a distress cry that summons **larger predator** from same species line (see next escalation).
    

**Reward / Information:**  
Study of its adaptations hints at long-term internal ecosystem evolution.

##  **6) Biomass Block Cache**

**Type:** Environmental / Puzzle

**Setup:**  
A cold-storage vault full of gray bricks, each labeled as **Energy-Class 3 Biocore Fuel**. Cooling systems hum weakly. Some bricks are swelling with internal gas pressure.

**Mechanics:**

- Perception or Investigation (DC 13) notices temperature rising.
    
- Engineering (DC 15) to reroute coolant.
    
- Mishandling bricks → 1 explodes (3d6 acid damage + toxic fumes).
    

**Logic:**  
Stored organic fuel requires sub-zero containment. The plant’s failing temperature regulation is causing fermentation and decomposition.

**Outcomes / Escalations:**

- Restoring cooling stabilizes stockpile.
    
- Failing causes chain reaction → must evacuate.
    
- Successful stabilization grants safe access to functional power cells.
    

**Reward / Information:**  
Recovered **2–3 stable fuel bricks** (can power devices or sell).

##  **7) Rogue Security Drone**

**Type:** Combat / Diplomacy

**Setup:**  
A hovering, four-limbed security construct patrols a sector. Its sensors focus on the intruders but do not attack immediately. It speaks in corrupted Elysian code:

> “Identify — directive mismatch — containment breach probable.”

**Mechanics:**

- Persuasion / Deception / Hacking (DC 15) can re-align IFF.
    
- Combat stats similar to CR 5–6 construct if hostilities begin.
    

**Logic:**  
It still protects the plant’s “core integrity,” but its friend-or-foe database is long gone.

**Outcomes / Escalations:**

- Repairing restores limited access to secure storage (it opens doors).
    
- Destroying it draws nearby drones.
    
- Partial success: it follows PCs under “escort protocol,” but will attack if they touch sealed panels.
    

**Reward / Information:**  
Access card or encryption key from its processor grants clearance in other sections.

##  **8) Live Specimen Captured**

**Type:** Moral Choice / Interaction

**Setup:**  
Inside a glass containment cage, a living animal (avian or mammal) thrashes weakly. Labels read:

> “Specimen 52-B — transport pending.”

Nearby drones monitor it with passive sensors.

**Mechanics:**

- Simple release requires bypassing lock (DC 14).
    
- Breaking cage alerts drones.
    
- Containment field can be disabled remotely via console.
    

**Logic:**  
An automated collection run mistakenly harvested a living creature and never delivered it.

**Outcomes / Escalations:**

- Freeing it harmlessly earns Nemamiah’s approval if reported later.
    
- Leaving it alone → it dies; drones recycle the body.
    
- Taking it causes drones to track “missing material.”
    

**Reward / Information:**  
The animal carries a data tag showing its capture date centuries ago — a time marker for ARK-5’s operational decay.

##  **9) Catwalk Collapse**

**Type:** Environmental Hazard

**Setup:**  
While crossing a high metal walkway over a digestion pit, bolts shear and part of the catwalk tilts.  
Below: a vat of bubbling bio-slurry.

**Mechanics:**

- Dexterity save (DC 14) to grab railing.
    
- Fall = 6d6 acid damage per round until rescued.
    
- Strength (Athletics) DC 14 to pull others up.
    

**Logic:**  
Constant vibration and corrosion weakened supports.

**Outcomes / Escalations:**

- Collapse opens new hole revealing maintenance conduit underneath.
    
- If PCs fall in, noise triggers nearby pumps, sucking slurry and dragging them toward processing chute.
    

**Reward / Information:**  
Discover maintenance tunnel → shortcut or hidden compartment.

##  **10) “Overlooked” Biocore**

**Type:** Discovery / Trap

**Setup:**  
A control platform overlooks the energy transfer belts. Among debris, a faint blue glow — a pristine **Biocore Unit** sealed in transparent casing.

**Mechanics:**

- Investigation (DC 12) identifies as high-output energy cell.
    
- Removing it triggers conveyor reactivation (Dex save DC 15 to avoid mechanical arm strike).
    

**Logic:**  
Unit left during shutdown sequence; removal registered as system anomaly.

**Outcomes / Escalations:**

- Safely extracted → valuable power source.
    
- If line reactivates, the plant begins processing again, awakening deeper systems (potentially alerting Adimus).
    

**Reward / Information:**  
Usable **power cell** worth significant research or market value.

##  **11) Signature Encounter – The Composer of Flesh**

**Type:** Major Threat / Boss

**Setup:**  
In a large circular reactor hall, dense organic mass pulses around a half-active converter. It resembles a mound of interwoven tendons, nerves, and armor fragments. Optical sensors embedded in flesh track movement.  
It speaks only in distorted maintenance logs.

**Behavior:**

- Moves by undulating, striking with pseudopods.
    
- Absorbs organic matter for regeneration.
    
- Seeks to integrate superior tissue samples.
    

**Mechanics:**

- Multi-phase fight; environmental hazards (steam bursts, acid pools).
    
- PCs can damage reactor cables to disable regeneration.
    
- Strength/Tech checks to redirect coolant and freeze it.
    

**Logic:**  
The Composer is the result of **bio-reactor self-correction algorithms** merging multiple tissue inputs into a “stable composite.” It gained minimal cognition through continuous feedback.

**Outcomes / Escalations:**

- Destroying it destabilizes power → blackouts across sector.
    
- Capturing data logs reveals early Adimus experiments; proof he manipulated reactor genetics.
    
- Failing to finish it → it escapes into vents for later reappearance.
    

**Reward / Information:**

- Unique **biological data core** containing centuries of self-mutation records.
    
- Optional **mutagenic sample** (valuable but dangerous).
