### Overview & Purpose:
- A colossal industrial complex built to convert biological material into a usable energy format for the megastructure. Using advanced enzymatic breakdown, catalytic organo-reactors, and bio-conversion arrays, it refined harvested specimens into stable energy modules for distribution.
- Once a critical power source, the facility continues semi-automatically despite the absence of oversight. Its systems still attempt to fulfill their last directive, albeit with limited inputs and degraded precision.

#### Atmosphere & Ambiance:
- Describe the sensory experience of being in this location.
    - **Visuals:** Exterior towers just above the artificial forest canopy like metal spires. Inside, dark metal catwalks cross above reactors filled with churning organic slurry. Stacks of old biocore cells sit in loading racks; many have ruptured over time.
    - **Sounds:** Low mechanical rumble. Conveyor belts clatter irregularly. Pumps hiss as they force partially liquefied biomass through pipes. Occasionally, something crunches deep within the machinery.
    - **Scents:** A mix of chemical preservatives, sour decay, burning protein, and hot metal.
    - **General Feel:** Functional but decayed — like an abandoned factory that never stopped running.
#### Key Features & Layout:
·         **1) Intake Gantry**  
The arrival point for harvested biomass; now mostly empty. A few dried specimens lie caught in metal cages.

·         **2) Enzyme Baths**  
Large tanks where organic matter is dissolved into slurry. Soft light through murky fluid reveals indistinct shapes undergoing breakdown.

·         **3) Biocore Reactors**  
Organometallic chambers where slurry is processed into energetic biocore units.  
Some reactors remain active; damaged ones flicker dangerously.

·         **4) Energy Module Storage**  
Rack-like vaults containing thousands of biofuel cells in various states of decay. Many are unsafe to handle.

**5) Drone Work Floor**  
Worker drones still attempt to move material through processing stages, sometimes without input, endlessly repeating motions.

#### History & Reputation:
- Originally one of the megastructure’s most essential facilities, the plant generated supplementary energy by processing excess organic material — either collected from observation zones or grown internally.

	After the Throne ceased issuing commands, the plant continued following its final instructions:

**convert biomass → store energy**

#### Current Situation & Hooks:
-·         The facility still runs — inefficiently.

·         Some reactors produce unstable energy cells.

·         Material jams periodically cause localized pressure explosions.

·         Drone routines misinterpret biological signatures, causing them to harvest non-designated organisms on sight.

**Hooks:**

·         Retrieve intact biofuel cells for research or reconstruction.

·         Investigate strange energy readings from a malfunctioning reactor.

·         Recover a missing survey team last detected in the plant.

·         Shut down an unstable reactor before it ruptures and contaminates nearby ecologies.

·         Determine why certain drones have begun collecting inorganic materials — a sign of deeper malfunction.
